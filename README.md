## About the project

Followed agile methodology. Added multiple additional functional features. Followed best coding practices.

## Agile Methodology
In software development, agile practices involve discovering requirements and developing solutions through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams and their customer/end user.
In this project, since the challenge was to do all of this on an individual basis, I started by figuring out the requirements, what all needs to be leart to get those functional features included and to create a responsive and interactive webpage. Then I planned on how to do those things one by one in an organised timely schedule.
