## About the project
To build a Microsoft Teams clone, a fully functional prototype with at least one mandatory functionality - a minimum of two participants being able connect with each other to have a video conversation. 
 Followed agile methodology. Added multiple additional functional features. Followed best coding practices.

## Agile Methodology
In software development, agile practices involve discovering requirements and developing solutions through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams and their customer/end user.
In this project, since the challenge was to do all of this on an individual basis, I started by figuring out the requirements, what all you need to leart to get those functional features included and  to create a responsive and interactive webpage. Then planned on how to do those things one by one in an organised manner and a timely schedule.
